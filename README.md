# Overview

On approach to the second milestone project, which derives on the learning of exploring through the 
fundamentals of JavaScript, the focus has progressively transitioned from a static site to one that is 
interactive that allows visitors to actively engage with data. It also completes what's known as the 
'trinity of web development' whereby this forms the basis of front-end development that concerns itself 
with data as presented through components such as HTML, CSS & JavaScript. The core attention of this 
project however, is to construct an interactive front-end website that responds to user's actions which 
revolves around a sense of engagement.
