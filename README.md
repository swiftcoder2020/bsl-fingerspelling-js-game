# Overview

As I approached the second milestone project, which derives on the learning experience of exploring 
through the fundamentals of JavaScript and the Interactive Front-End Development modules (which focuses 
on jQuery, Application Programming Interfaces (abbreviated as API) and utilising an email service), 
attention has now progressively transitioned from a static site to one that will become interactive 
whereby it allows visitors to actively engage with data. It also completes what's known as the 'trinity 
of web development' that forms the basis of front-end development which concerns itself with components 
such as HTML, CSS and the addition of JavaScript or any of its associations.

The core focal point of this project will consist of constructing an interactive front-end website that 
will provide the value of enabling users a sense of engagement and to interact with the data as presented 
in order to achieve their personal goal by responding to their actions actively.

# User Experience Design

## Project Goals

The sole purpose into this website is one that originated through coincidence via a discussion with a 
tutor who had expressed an interest in a subject that relates to oneself personally and was requesting 
some resources into it. This lead to an identifiable moment of inspiration into a conceptual idea towards 
the project in constructing an interactive front-end website.

This was established in that it represents a window of opportunity into the development of a memory 
matching game that has an objective of it being educational to the users, specifically aiming to raise 
awareness of deafness as a whole by introducing British Sign Language (abbreviated as BSL). This in my 
view was an excellent idea to utilise the functionality & capability of the JavaScript language that 
would enable users either with a vested interest or as a new interest into a hobby to practise and 
improve on their BSL fingerspelling skills.

## Strategy

The approach into the construction serves as a purpose of demonstrating the knowledge and skills obtained 
within the programming language of JavaScript and jQuery, by way of providing new/returning visitors the 
key to an open door as an introduction, (that is akin to the Code Institute's 5 day coding challenge), 
into the community of the deaf society and how they communicate to one another.

The value in this would be based on the hope to create an impact that influences a positive contribution 
to this community, especially and yet significantly more so under the current times of the pandemic. The 
objective of it is that it encourages potential users to use the social qualities of being considerate 
and thoughtful in the manner of being helpful by engaging to communicate with them to break through the 
social barriers or assisting them in their difficulties.

Also research was undertaken to establish if such a game exists which will form the basis of this project 
and it was with luck that one has been developed through a resourceful website.

To summarise the website project's goals:

* To demonstrate the implementation of acquiring a new knowledge & skill in JavaScript whilst 
supplementing the experience of HTML & CSS to the design & development of the project.
* To provide an interactive educational game to target interested users with the objective of achieving 
in acquiring the knowledge and in addition the ability to fingerspell or action in motion the alphabet in 
BSL as a foundation.
* To construct a game that elicits a positive user experience in a way that it encourages new/returning 
visitors to continue the learning experience in an engaging way that is resourceful to them.

## Scope

### User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to understand with ease into the sole purpose and comprehend the rationale 
as to why the website has been built and developed so I can see if it is relevant or of interest to me.
* As a user, I want to be assured that the website overall and its content can be viewed clearly on a 
range of devices to enable an opportunity to be flexible in my learning.
* As a user, I expect to be given instructions as guidance into the rules which is easily understood as 
to how the game is to be played and the learning outcome of it to experience the benefit of utilising it.
* As a user, I want to comfortably be allowed to commence the game when I am prepared and it is suitably 
convenient to proceed so I can perform this to the best of my ability.
* As a user, when presented, I expect to see a clear image depicting an alphabet in BSL in sequence to 
form a word and have the ability to replicate the sign so that I can be competently confident when 
applying it in the real world to achieve a personal goal.
* As a user, I want to be provided with a resourceful section consisting of content as a guiding reference 
point, that would easily be referred to and assist me when there is a moment of doubt.
* As a user, I want the game to determine whether my answer was correct or incorrect and that there is 
clear feedback that is complimentary and encouraging in a positive manner at any stage in the game.
* As a user, I expect the game to offer the option to restart, subsequent to the current play mode 
that has finished to allow me to continue my learning and make progress.
* As a user, I would like to visually view my score in the current game to gain confidence in the ability 
to learn so that I can demonstrate it by motion in reality.
* As a user, I would like to access any further resources that would supplement or advance my learning, 
should I wish to dedicate a commitment in making a difference within a community.
* As a user, I expect to be able to access contact details into the owner of the website, should I wish 
to reach out by raising queries, commend the game by providing feedback.
* As a user, I would like to explore other projects that the developer has constructed to assess their 
range of technical skills and level of competency so that I can establish if it is of interest to me.

### Features

The features which I envisage to incorporate into project are as follows:

* An introductory heading section that delves into the purpose of the website
* A BSL Fingerspelling game that will be interactively engaging
* Instructions that clearly defines into the usage of how the game is to be played
* Various high quality images that depicts a sign into an alphabetic letter 
* The ability to flash <!--increases & decreases in size so that the image is still visible--> each image 
to form a sequence into a word
* The ability where users can select their appropriate speed level of how slow/fast the images flashes
* A start button to activate the play
* A timer that is based on each word that a user is given as opposed to the whole time allocated to 
complete the game
* An interactive event that determines whether a letter or word is incorrect when typed in
* A replay button that allows users to review the letters that has been displayed
* A positive/encouraging message when a letter or word is correct or not
* An small area that calculates the score per word which builds up to the total score
* An overview message into the progress of their learning and to provide positive encouragement

These items are above are determined in the below table:

## Structure

The structure into the website project I feel will greatly benefit the new/returning users by constructing 
in this instance various sections within a webpage, again to break up the content appropriately with the 
sole major developmental focus being on the section that provides an interactive game utilising the 
programming language of JavaScript. Again, this website has been identified to be of a simple and linear 
structure, enough to create a functional yet resourceful method of learning a new skill.

### Interaction Design (IXD)

It was immediately yet concretely identified when approaching this project with some guidance that I had 
to consider the principle of keeping this concept as simple and effective as possible given that the world 
of JavaScript was an unfamiliar territory to me thus this journey had been and will be a steep learning 
curve overall.

Taking into consideration of the aforementioned specified user stories, the structure design and 
interactive features will consist of:

* A header that explicitly displays text entitled as 'British Sign Language Fingerspelling Game'

* An introductory paragraph that provides an explanation into the purpose and rationale of the 
construction, that will immediately enable new/returning visitors to recognise if they wish to express an 
interest into it

* The rendering of the design structure into its layout, especially the section of the JavaScript game 
which proportionally fits well across all breakpoints that ensures of its responsiveness and that it is 
playable

<!-- Given that the construction into the game involves JavaScript which is an interactive programming 
language, it has been identified that there will be a few essential design elements that encourages the 
interaction between the website and the users that would elicit a positive emotive response such so that 
it creates a good user experience. The JavaScript specific interactive elements are as follows:

* Upon the game webpage being loaded, users will have the option to choose their speed level from easy, 
medium and hard (which is represented as slow, normal and fast) that dictates on how slow/fast the images 
are to be flashed visually for them to cognitively process what each image represents.

* Users will also be given the option to share their name so that this can be included in the positive
encouragement messages in the duration of the game.

* Once the speed level has been comfortably selected by the user, the start game button allows visitors 
to commence the play and initiate the images to flash.

* A timer is activated once the start game button has been clicked on and will be  -->

<!-- Testing - this will be more complex according to Igor as functionality will require testing as well 
as display and responsiveness -->
