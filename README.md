# Overview

On approach to the second milestone project, which derives on the learning experience of exploring 
through the fundamentals of JavaScript and the Interactive Front-End Development module, the focus has 
progressively transitioned from a static site to one that will become interactive that allows visitors to 
actively engage with data. It also completes what's known as the 'trinity of web development' whereby 
this forms the basis of front-end development that concerns itself with data as presented through 
components such as HTML, CSS & the addition of JavaScript. The core attention of this project however, is 
to construct an interactive front-end website that responds to user's actions which revolves around a 
sense of engagement.

# User Experience Design

## Project Goals

The sole purpose into this website is one that originated through a discussion with a tutor who had 
expressed an interest in a subject that relates to oneself and was requesting some resources into it 
which lead to an identifiable moment of inspiration into a conceptual idea of a project that focuses on 
an interactive front-end website. This was established as a window of opportunity into the goal of the 
second project, which is to develop a memory matching game that is educational to the users, specifically 
aiming to raise awareness of British Sign Language (abbreviated as BSL). This in my view was an excellent 
idea to utilise the functionality & capability of the JavaScript language that would enable users either 
with a vested interest or as a new interest into a hobby to practise and improve on their fingerspelling 
skills.

## Strategy

The construction into this website serves as a purpose of demonstrating the knowledge and skills obtained 
within the programming language of JavaScript and providing new/returning users the key to an open door 
as an introduction, that is akin to the Code Institute's 5 day coding challenge, into the community of 
the deaf society such as how they communicate with to one another. The value in this project would be the 
hope to influence a positive impact towards this community, especially and yet significantly more so 
under the current times of the pandemic whereby it encourages potential users to use the quality of being 
considerate and thoughtful in helpfulness by engaging to communicate with them to break through the social 
barriers or assisting them in their difficulties.

To summarise the website project's goals:

* To demonstrate the implementation of acquiring a new skill in JavaScript whilst supplementing the 
experience of HTML & CSS to the design & development of the project
* To provide an interactive educational game for interested users with the objective of achieving in 
acquiring the knowledge and in addition the ability to fingerspell or action in motion the alphabet in 
BSL
* To construct a game that elicits a positive user experience in a way that it encourages new/returning 
visitors to continue the learning experience in an engaging way that is resourceful to them
