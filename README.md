# Overview

On approach to the second milestone project, which derives on the learning experience of exploring 
through the fundamentals of JavaScript and the Interactive Front-End Development module, the focus has 
progressively transitioned from a static site to one that is interactive that allows visitors to actively 
engage with data. It also completes what's known as the 'trinity of web development' whereby this forms 
the basis of front-end development that concerns itself with data as presented through components such as 
HTML, CSS & JavaScript. The core attention of this project however, is to construct an interactive 
front-end website that responds to user's actions which revolves around a sense of engagement.

# User Experience Design

## Project Goals

The sole purpose into this website is one that derived through a discussion with a tutor who had 
expressed an interest in a subject that relates to oneself and was requesting a resource into it which 
lead to an identifiable moment of inspiration into a conceptual idea of a project that focuses on an 
interactive front-end website. This was established as an opportunity into the goal of second project, 
which is to develop a memory matching game that is educational to the users, specifically aiming to raise 
awareness of British Sign Language (abbreviated as BSL).
